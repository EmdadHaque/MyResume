### Project Portfolio

- **Serverless Web App** - This is a demo for hosting a serverless web app using AWS services:
S3
API Gateway
Lambda
RDS / Dynamo DB
This demo will retrieve lines from my favourite poem "Death, be not proud" by John Donne.

The web page is hosted on S3.
Javascript will call API Gateway which will trigger Lambda.
Python code running on Lambda function will retrieve lines from a manaaged DB (RDS / Dynamo DB) and feedback to website.
