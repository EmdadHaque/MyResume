### PROJECT PORTFOLIO

- **[Serverless Web App](https://eh-serverless-webapp-proj1.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}**

   This is a demo for hosting a web app using serverless AWS services:
   1. S3 for hosting HTML website that uses JavaScript for API calls
   2. API Gateway for handling API calls
   3. Lambda for app logic coded in Python
   4. Dynamo DB for storing data

&nbsp;
- **[Automate the deployment of applications to Azure Windows Virtual Machines](./projects/deploy_app_to_azure_vms)**

   The aim of this project is to automate the installation of applications on Windows VMs in Azure in the absence of any configuration management tools.

&nbsp;
- **[RDP to an Azure VM using MS Entra ID credentials](./projects/rdp_to_azure_vm_with_entra_id)**

   In this project, Azure VPN and MS Entra ID with the built-in MFA are used to secure the Remote Desktop Connection to an Azure VM.
   
&nbsp;
- **[Automate JIT RDP Access to Azure VMs with Approvals using M365 Forms and Azure Logic Apps ](./projects/ms_forms_logic_app_jit_access_approval)**

   Here, I have demonstrated how to use M365 Forms to collect end-user responses to trigger an Azure Logic App, which in turn, securely creates the JIT Access after the request has been approved by an approver. The requestor is also notified via email of confirmation or rejection of their JIT Access request.
